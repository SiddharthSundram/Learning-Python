## Dictionary
# dict1 = {"x":1,"y":2,"z":3}
# print(dict1, type(dict1))
# print(dict1["x"])
# dict1["y"] = 123 #changing value using assignment operator
# print(dict1)
# dict1["w"] = 30 #adding new key: value using assignment operator
# print(dict1)
# print(dict1.get("a"))    #getting value using get() by putting key in it.
# print(dict1.get("x"))    
# myDict = {1:"Siddharth",3:2,"Roll":6}
# print(myDict)
